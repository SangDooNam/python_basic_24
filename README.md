# function-basics-01



**Task 1: Basic Function**

Write a Python function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.



**Task 2: Function with Conditional Logic**

Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.


**Task 3: Function with Default Argument**

Write a function that takes two arguments, one required and the other with a default value, and returns their product.


**Task 4: Function with a Loop**

Write a function that takes an integer as input and prints all the numbers from 1 to that integer.


**Task 5: Function with While Loop**

Write a function that takes an integer as input and prints all the numbers from 1 to that integer using a while loop.


**Task 6: Function with String Manipulation**

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string.


**Task 7: Function with Input Validation**

Write a function that takes a string as input and checks if it contains only alphabetic characters (no digits or special characters).


**Task 8: Function with Multiple Returns**

Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns "Positive," "Negative," or "Zero" based on the number's sign.


**Task 9: Function with Input Validation (Part 2)**

Write a function that takes a string as input and checks if it's a valid email address using regular expressions.



**Task 10: Function with Multiple Arguments**

Write a function that takes five numbers as input and returns the maximum, minimum, and average of those numbers.


**Exercise 11: Function with Variable Scope**

Write a function that demonstrates variable scope by defining a variable inside the function and trying to access it outside the function.



**Exercise 12: Function Composition**

Write two functions, `square` and `double`, where `square` takes an integer as input and returns its square, and `double` takes an integer as input and returns double that value. Then, write a third function that combines these two functions to first square and then double a given integer.
